# 🎬 CineGuard AI  
### Self-Learning Movie Review Manipulation Detection System

CineGuard AI is an end-to-end anomaly detection system that identifies potential movie review manipulation using behavioral signals from live OMDb API data.

This project demonstrates a complete Data Science pipeline including API ingestion, feature engineering, unsupervised learning, anomaly score calibration, secure API handling, and interactive deployment using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Online movie ratings may exhibit abnormal engagement patterns due to artificial boosting or coordinated activity.

CineGuard AI detects **statistical anomalies** in rating behavior using an unsupervised learning approach.

The system:

- Fetches real-time movie data from OMDb API  
- Extracts behavioral features  
- Applies Isolation Forest for anomaly detection  
- Calibrates anomaly scores to a 0–100 Fraud Risk scale  
- Displays explainable results in a Streamlit dashboard  
- Stores searched movies in SQLite for future retraining  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### 🔹 Model Used
Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection)

### 🔹 Why Unsupervised?
There is no publicly available labeled dataset for movie review manipulation.  
Therefore, anomaly detection is a practical solution.

### 🔹 Feature Engineering

The model uses:

- IMDb Rating  
- IMDb Vote Count  
- Runtime  
- Movie Age  
- Sentiment Score (TextBlob on plot summary)  
- Rating-Vote Ratio (rating / log(votes))  

### 🔹 Score Calibration

Raw anomaly scores from `decision_function()` are normalized using the training distribution range to produce a stable 0–100 Fraud Risk Score.

## 📊 Example Risk Predictions

Below are sample predictions generated by the system:

- 🟢 Low Risk → (Inception)  
- 🟡 Moderate Risk → (Dhurandhar)  
- 🔴 High Risk → (The Room)  

⚠ Note:  
The system detects statistical anomalies in rating behavior, not confirmed fraud.
